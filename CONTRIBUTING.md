## Style guide

### Skill files (`skills/*/SKILL.md`, `methodology/*.md`)

- **200-line hard ceiling per file.** Not a guideline — if you exceed it, decompose.
- Every skill file must have valid YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `allowed-tools`.
- List only the tools the skill actually calls in `allowed-tools`. No speculative inclusions.
- Instructions to Claude go in prose outside code fences. Instructions inside a `bash` fence are read as shell commands, not as directives to the model — keep this distinction intentional.
- One responsibility per skill. A skill that does two things should be two skills.

### Shell scripts (`hooks/scripts/*.sh`, `tests/**/*.sh`)

- `set -euo pipefail` at the top of every script.
- No hardcoded paths — use `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` or derive paths from `$0`.
- Quote all variable expansions: `"$VAR"`, `"${VAR}"`.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Rename before you comment.

### Python (`mcp/*.py`)

- Python 3.11+.
- Type annotations on all function signatures.
- No mutable default arguments.
- No bare `except:` — catch specific exceptions.
- `ruff` for formatting and linting. Line length: 100.
