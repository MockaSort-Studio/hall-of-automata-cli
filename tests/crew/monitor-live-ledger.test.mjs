// createLiveLedgerTracker no longer depends on a same-process Runtime --
// it connects directly to a run's own Comm controller over WebSocket, as a
// dedicated observer actor distinct from "main" (see monitor-live-ledger.mjs's
// header for why). This harness spins up a real CommController and drives
// the tracker the same way a real, separate-process TUI session would:
// over the wire, with a second independent WS client emitting the
// kickoff/report envelopes. It also calls comm.registerPlan() itself, the
// same way Runtime.launchCrew() now does for a real run, so the server
// actually owns a ledger for this run's namespace before the tracker asks
// for a snapshot/subscription.
