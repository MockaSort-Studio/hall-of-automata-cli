# Armory suite distribution: decision record

Status: decided 2026-10-03. Revisit triggers are listed at the end.

## Problem

A Crew worker runs in a Linux Gondolin VM whose CPU architecture matches the
host (QEMU only accelerates a matching guest). Armory suites are therefore Linux
closures: `x86_64-linux` (Linux, Intel Macs) and `aarch64-linux` (Apple silicon).
A Mac cannot build them (no Linux builder), and evaluating the suite flake
downloads nixpkgs (about 1 GB of store). Distribution must be cross-OS, fast,
and light, and a missing artifact must degrade to a host-only Crew, never fail.

## Options considered

| Option | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| **A. Nix on the client, CI-built Linux closures in a Cachix binary cache** | **Chosen** |
| B. CI-built closure tarballs (sha256 in the catalog), no Nix on the client | Deferred; clean second step |
| C. FlakeHub Cache | Rejected: paid plans only; pulling needs `determinate-nixd login` |
| D. Local Linux builder on every Mac | Rejected: sudo setup, GBs of disk, slow first build |
| E. Host-only Crews | Kept as the automatic fallback, not the product |

## Why Nix won (A)

- It is the mechanism already built and tested: catalog resolves a channel to an
  immutable revision, suites are flake outputs, closures are exact store paths
  mounted read-only through the filtered `/nix/store` provider.
- The suite flake is pinned, so output paths are identical on every machine. CI
  builds once per system; clients substitute and never build (about 30 s CI
  builds, and no client builder).
- Nix deduplicates shared closure pieces (node, gh) across suites and fetches
  only missing paths. Tarballs would re-ship them per suite.
- Signature and key verification come from Nix; B would make us own that trust
  model (catalog hashes and attestations).
- A local build remains possible when an artifact is missing or a suite author is
  iterating, which B cannot offer.
- The user accepted one-time client setup in exchange for the above.

## Cost of A, stated plainly

- Each machine needs Nix and one cache entry, which needs root once.
- This install's `trusted-users` is only `root`, so a client cannot add a
  substituter per call. The cache must be in `extra-substituters` and
  `extra-trusted-public-keys`.
- Pulling the first time costs a download of the runtime closure only (build
  tools are not fetched). Closure size is still to be measured.
- Windows has no native Nix. Windows hosts take the host fallback (WSL2 is fine).

## Bootstrap options researched

| Option | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Determinate installer | One command, needs root (creates the `/nix` volume on macOS). Chosen. |
| `nix-portable` | Rootless and zero-config, but Linux only; explicitly no macOS support. Possible rootless fallback on Linux; not validated with this repo. |
| FlakeHub Cache | Already trusted by Determinate installs, but paid and needs login. Rejected. |
| Per-call `--option extra-substituters` | Ignored for untrusted users. Making the user trusted is effectively root equivalence; rejected. |
| Run Nix inside a Gondolin guest | Would remove host Nix, but is unvalidated (guest Nix availability, network policy, persisting the store to the host). A spike, not a plan. |
| Tarball artifacts (B) | Removes Nix from the client entirely; see revisit triggers. |

macOS cannot avoid one elevated step: the `/nix` volume requires root. The
practical minimum is therefore one command and one password prompt, which
`scripts/setup-env.sh` provides: it installs Nix if missing, adds the Armory
cache to `/etc/nix/nix.custom.conf`, restarts the daemon, and verifies. It never
runs implicitly; the Crew only reports it (preflight message, host fallback).

## Assessment: Nix inside a Gondolin guest

Not an anti-pattern: a Linux VM running Nix to realize Linux closures is how
macOS Nix already works (`darwin.linux-builder`, Determinate's native Linux
builder). Our variant would only fetch from the cache into a host directory,
never build, so the host needs no Nix, no root, and no client config (we are
root inside the VM and set the substituters there).

It is probably overkill for us. It trades a one-time install for a permanent
moving part: a guest image with a static Nix, guest network policy for the cache
hosts, a writable host mount that preserves symlinks, executable bits, and the
Nix database, a VM boot on every cache miss, and harder debugging. Tarballs
(option B) remove Nix from the client with less machinery and need only a CI
export step plus catalog fields. Choose Nix-in-a-guest only if we want to keep
Nix semantics (deduplication, signatures, local builds) without a host install,
and then after a measured spike, not before.

## Cache policy

- Only CI pushes (hall-armory `packages.yml`, per affected suite, after tests,
  `main` only). Pull requests build without credentials or upload.
- The token should live in a GitHub Environment restricted to `main`, so a
  writer's branch cannot use it to publish artifacts clients would trust.
- Warming is unnecessary for correctness: pinned store paths never change.
  Run `cache-sync.yml` manually after cache cleanup or a retention change.
- Cache: `https://hall-armory.cachix.org`, key
  `hall-armory.cachix.org-1:xKu3F2f2lHnVSl9gyFi5Fsk2rs724sILlfdEIHWjWrc=`.

## Measurements (2026-10-03, Apple silicon, `aarch64-linux` guest)

- CI: each system builds in about 30 s. The fetch-only verify (`--max-jobs 0`)
  passes on Ubuntu and on a macOS runner, so Macs substitute without a builder.
- Client, true cold start from an empty store: 2 min 59 s. Steady state after
  it: the store is the Nix install (about 180 MB) plus the 325 MB suite closure
  (67 paths); `~/.cache/nix` stays under 1 MB.
- A reading of 836 MB was taken immediately after that run and was gone minutes
  later without a collection. Its cause is unknown and unverified; it is not
  attributed to flake evaluation. Profile cold start in phases (evaluation vs
  closure download) before optimizing either.
- Client, warm: 1.4 s. Each closure is rooted under
  `~/.cache/hall/armory/roots/<suite>-<system>` so garbage collection cannot
  force another cold fetch; a newer revision overwrites the link.
- The closure is a full Linux userspace: nodejs-slim 90 MB, glibc 47, icu 42,
  gh 39, npm 13, gcc libs 10. Building instead would need the same closure plus
  the build tools (a CI verify log showed 126 paths, 260 MiB download and
  802 MiB unpacked) and a compile, so substituting is the smaller option.

## Revisit triggers (move to B, tarballs)

- Several suites make duplicated downloads or disk use material.
- Install friction blocks adoption, or Windows-native hosts matter.
- Cachix retention or limits become a recurring operational cost.

B is additive: CI keeps `nix build`, adds a deterministic closure export, and the
client points the filtered-store provider at an extracted directory (its backend
is already injectable). Nix would remain as the dev and fallback path.
